# Strings and Numbers

For this assignment, you'll be evaluating some simple and not as simple strings and numbers.


### Guidelines

* Use RunJS to evaluate your strings and numbers, and take a screenshot and submit it when you're done with the entire set.


### Steps

1. Evaluate three strings. Could be anything. At least one should have an apostrophe in it, and you can handle that with either a backslash or a double-quoted string.
2. Evaluate your first name as a string.
3. Evaluate your last name as a string.
4. Evaluate both as one string. Don't forget the space!
5. Evaluate both in two or more strings, but add them together into one string. Don't forget the space!
6. Evaluate a string with an apostrophe in it.
7. Evaluate three numbers on three separate lines, with at least one negative number and at least one floating-point number (a number with a decimal point).
8. Evaluate the result of adding two numbers together.
9. Evaluate the result of subtracting two numbers together.
10. Evaluate the result of multiplying two numbers together.
11. Evaluate the result of dividing two numbers.
12. Evaluate the result of running a modulus operation of one number by another.
13. Evaluate the result of multiplying two numbers and then adding a third.
14. Evaluate the result of adding two numbers and THEN multiplying the result of that by a third. Parentheses will help!
15. Evaluate the type of a number.
16. Evaluate the type of a string.

**Bonus:**  Evaluate the type of getting the type of a number.
